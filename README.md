# MolKit

A Swift-version of a cheminformatics library, shamelessly based off of OpenBabel to make adoption feel intuitive. 
To use openbabel from Swift, it would have needed C++ __<->__ Obj-C++ __<->__ Swift wrappers, so might as well write it in pure Swift then.  

## WARNING  

Currently in very very early development, and not even close to being usable. Once the base molecule class is working, then things will become interesting. Shortly after will arrive the basic file parsers, and then the fun stuff.
